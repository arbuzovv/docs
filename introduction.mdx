    Choose the dataset (daily, minute, fundamental, or alternative) for your backtest.

2. **Run Backtest:**

    Execute the backtest in the cloud.

3. **Analyze Results:**

    Examine the results through interactive graphs, tables, and reports.

### Managing Backtests

1. **Save Backtest:**

    Save the backtest results for future reference.

2. **Compare Backtests:**

    Compare the performance of different backtests to evaluate strategy improvements.

## Example Workflow

### Step 1: Strategy Description

```
I want to create a momentum-based trading strategy that buys stocks that have increased by more than 5% in the last 10 days and sells them after a 10% gain or a 5% loss.
```

### Step 2: AI Code Generation

<CodeGroup>
  ```python zipline.py
  from zipline.api import order, record, symbol

  def initialize(context):
      context.lookback = 10
      context.gain_threshold = 0.10
      context.loss_threshold = -0.05

  def handle_data(context, data):
      for stock in context.portfolio.positions:
          current_price = data.current(stock, 'price')
          historical_prices = data.history(stock, 'price', bar_count=context.lookback, frequency='1d')
          price_change = (current_price - historical_prices[0]) / historical_prices[0]
          
          if price_change > 0.05:
              order(stock, 1)
          elif price_change > context.gain_threshold or price_change < context.loss_threshold:
              order(stock, -1)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Running the Backtest

1. **Select Data:**

    Choose daily data for US stocks.

2. **Run Backtest:**

    Execute the backtest in the cloud.

3. **Analyze Results:**

    Review the performance metrics and visualizations.

### Step 4: Saving and Comparing

1. **Save Backtest:**

    Save the backtest results.

2. **Compare Backtests:**

    Compare with previous backtests to assess strategy improvements.
