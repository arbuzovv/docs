Ziplime integrates the Zipline backtester, a powerful and flexible tool originally developed as the core of the Quantopian platform. Zipline is designed for high-performance historical data testing, allowing users to evaluate their trading strategies with precision. Here's a look at the key features and syntax of the Zipline backtester:

**Key Features**

1. **Event-Driven System**: Zipline operates on an event-driven system, simulating market dynamics by processing historical data in chronological order.

2. **Pandas Integration**: It utilizes `pandas`, a popular data analysis library in Python, to handle time series data efficiently, making it easy to manipulate and analyze financial datasets.

3. **Diverse Data Support**: Zipline supports a variety of data types, including daily and minute bar data, fundamental data, and alternative datasets.

4. **Built-in Indicators and Metrics**: Users can incorporate a wide range of pre-built technical indicators and performance metrics to enhance strategy evaluation.

5. **Modular and Extensible**: Its modular design allows users to extend its capabilities by adding custom functions and components, tailoring the backtester to specific requirements.

#### Basic Syntax and Workflow

To use the Zipline backtester, users typically write a Python script defining their strategy. Below is a basic outline of the syntax and workflow:

* **Import Libraries**:
  Start by importing necessary libraries, including Zipline and `pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd
from zipline.api import order, record, symbol
```

* **Initialize Function:**
  Define the `initialize()` function to set initial parameters and variables for the trading algorithm.

```python
def initialize(context):
    context.asset = symbol('AAPL')
    context.short_mavg = 50
    context.long_mavg = 200
```

* **Handle Data Function**

  * Implement the `handle_data()` function, which contains the logic executed on each iteration of the backtester, such as calculating indicators and placing orders.

```python
def handle_data(context, data):
    short_mavg = data.history(context.asset, 'price', context.short_mavg, '1d').mean()
    long_mavg = data.history(context.asset, 'price', context.long_mavg, '1d').mean()

    if short_mavg > long_mavg:
        order(context.asset, 10)
    elif short_mavg < long_mavg:
        order(context.asset, -10)

    record(AAPL=data.current(context.asset, 'price'))

```
