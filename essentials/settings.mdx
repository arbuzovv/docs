**Backtest Frequency**

* **Daily or Minute Data**: Users can set the frequency of their backtests to either daily or minute intervals. By default, backtests are conducted using minute data, providing high-resolution insights into strategy performance. However, switching to daily data can be beneficial for broader trend analysis and less granular strategies.

#### Backtest Period

* **Customizable Timeframe**: You can define the specific time period over which your backtests will be conducted. This flexibility allows traders to test strategies over historical data spanning different market conditions, ensuring robustness and adaptability of the strategy.

#### AI Assistant Configuration

* **Strategic Guidance**: Customize the AI assistant settings to better fit your strategy development needs. Adjust the level of assistance, from providing basic code suggestions to offering complex optimizations and enhancements. This feature ensures that the AI functions as an effective collaborator in crafting and refining your trading algorithms.

#### Server Selection

* **Computation Environment**: Choose from a selection of servers to run your backtests and computations. This option allows for optimization of computational resources based on your specific requirements, such as processing speed and data handling capabilities, ensuring efficient and timely strategy evaluations.

By adjusting these parameters, users have greater control over their trading simulations and development process, enabling a more precise and effective approach to algorithmic trading on the Ziplime platform.
