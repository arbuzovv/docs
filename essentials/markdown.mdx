**Guidelines for Writing Prompts**

1. **Be Specific:** Clearly define the trading logic, including entry and exit conditions. Specify the type of assets or markets you're interested in.

2. **Include Timeframes:** Mention the desired timeframes for your strategy, whether it's intraday, daily, weekly, etc.

3. **Define Indicators:** Specify any technical indicators or fundamental metrics you want to incorporate.

4. **Clarify Objectives:** State your performance objectives, such as maximizing return, minimizing risk, or achieving a specific Sharpe ratio.

5. **Add Constraints:** Include any constraints such as risk tolerance, position limits, or transaction costs.

6. **Iterate and Refine:** Start with a simple prompt and gradually refine it based on the AI's output and your strategic goals.

#### Examples of Effective Prompts

**Example 1: strategies based on technical indicators**

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Moving Average strategy
  Create a strategy for trading U.S. stocks using a moving average crossover technique. 
  Use a 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and a 200-day SMA. 
  Enter a long position when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA, and 
  exit the position when the 50-day SMA crosses below.
  ```

  ```typescript Momentum strategy
  Develop a momentum strategy for ETFs. 
  Identify ETFs with the top 10% highest relative strength over the past 6 months. 
  Enter positions in these ETFs and rebalance the portfolio monthly. 
  Target a risk level to maintain a maximum drawdown below 10%. 
  Include transaction costs of 0.1% per trade.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Example 2: strategies based on fundamental data**

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Earnings-Based Strategy
  Design a strategy for futures trading based on earnings 
  announcements. Enter a position in futures contracts 
  if the company reports earnings that exceed analyst expectations 
  by more than 10%. Exit the trade one day 
  after the earnings announcement. Incorporate a stop-loss of 2% and take-profit of 5%.
  ```
